# The Gaming Room Software Design 

## Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
#### The Gaming Room wanted a fun game called Draw It or Lose It, where players guess drawings from a big collection of pictures. They wanted it to work on different devices like phones and computers.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
#### I did a good job of explaining things clearly in the document. I made sure each part was easy to understand, even for people who aren't experts.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
#### Making the design document helped me plan everything out before starting. It let me see any problems and come up with solutions early on, which made coding easier later.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
#### If I could change one thing, I'd add more pictures or diagrams to show how the software works. Visuals can make things easier to understand.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#### To meet the user's needs, I talked to them a lot and did research. It's important to think about what users want because it helps make the game better and more enjoyable.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
#### I designed the software by carefully thinking about what it needed to do and how different parts would work together. In the future, I'll keep using methods like talking to users, trying out ideas, and improving as I go to make sure the software fits their needs and works well.
